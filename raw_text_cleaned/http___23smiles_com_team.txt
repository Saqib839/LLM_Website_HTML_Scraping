He then moved on to Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge to pursue a biochemistry degree with the intent of applying to dental school. Dr. Young began his dental education at Louisiana State University (LSU) School of Dentistry in 1999 and graduated in 2003. He worked as an associate dentist and completed many hours of continuing education, including training in

Dr. Young completed dental implant training at Misch Resnik Implant Institute in California, in 2016-17. He has also completed the Progressive Orthodonitic Seminars Program, a part of the McGann Postgraduate School of Dentistry.
Advanced Dental Services
Preventive care is, of course, the mainstay of any good dental practice. Through regular exams and cleanings, Dr. Young and our staff want to keep you from experiencing any oral health issues. Nonetheless, we recognize that problems may still occur, and we are ready to serve you in whatever capacity you need.
Through restorative care, Dr. Young can repair decayed, cracked, and otherwise damaged teeth. Our restorations include fillings, crowns, and root canal therapy. We are especially excited to prepare same-day crowns for qualifying patients. With this option, Dr. Young can prep your tooth and attach a restoration in just one appointment. Plus, same-day crowns are made in the office with strong, high-grade dental porcelain that mimics the translucency of natural tooth enamel.
Dr. Young also performs offers orthodontic treatments, allowing you to choose from traditional braces, Invisalign
®
,
and Clear Correct. Because of his training and experience, Dr. Young’s orthodontic patients enjoy straighter, healthier, more attractive smiles.
In addition, we offer a full range of cosmetic treatments, which we can customize to meet your needs. When you visit us, we can explain options that will address your needs, including teeth whitening, veneers, bonding and contouring, and gum contouring.
Our Commitment to You
No matter what type of treatment you are going to receive, we want to make sure you are completely at ease beforehand. Dr. Young or a member of our staff will explain each step of the procedure and answer all of your questions.
We recognize that, in some cases, patients still have some apprehension. If needed, we can provide sedation dentistry, including both nitrous oxide and oral sedation, to help you relax.
Insurance and Financing
Of course, feeling comfortable about your care also means feeling confident about your payment options. We will file your insurance claim on your behalf as a courtesy, and our staff can help you with any questions about your claim. In certain circumstances, we can extend in-house credit. We also accept CareCredit
®
. If you have questions about your financing, a member of our office staff will be happy to assist you before your procedure.

I received an appointment the same day like within 20 minutes of calling. When I made it there I was seen by the doctor in a very timely manner, and the following week my procedures went well. I have even referred friends to him, and I will continue to. Awesome dentist, with awesome staff, it felt wonderful to deal with such friendly and professional people…
