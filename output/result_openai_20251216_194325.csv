https://www.allsmilespediatricdentist.com/meet-dr-job,Dr. Allen Job,"Providing dentistry for children requires a calling. As a profession, it requires having a strong clinical skill set, a keen understanding of medical conditions, knowledge and application of child psychology, and most importantly, compassion and patience. I have always enjoyed working with children and adolescents, and love being able to help them with their oral health needs. Each day, as I meet with new patients and their parents, I challenge myself to make a positive impact during their visit. Many parents come burdened with fear, from their own past experiences, wishing their child will not have to go through the same. I am reminded daily of the responsibility parents place in my hands, to treat their children with the utmost care and respect. I listen to my patients’ concerns and strive to provide a caring, safe environment in which to have their treatment. It is through each encounter, one patient at a time, that we are able to make a difference in the lives of those we are honored to serve. I provide lip and tongue tie treatment using a soft tissue laser. I have been trained and certified to use the dental laser since 2002. Click here to read more about this procedure and how it may assist your child. Education and Continuing Education Board Certified, American Board of Pediatric Dentistry Loma Linda University Doctorate of Dental Surgery Loma Linda University, Master of Science in Pediatric Dentistry Loma Linda University, Master of Public Health in Health Administration Loma Linda University, Master of Science in Physiology Johns Hopkins University , Graduate Studies University of Maryland at College Park , Bachelor of Science in Physiology and Neurobiology World Clinical Laser Institute Each year I attend lectures and simulations, and take online courses, to gain knowledge of the latest trends and techniques in treating pediatric dental patients. From 2003 to 2017 I have served as Assistant Professor of Pediatric Dentistry at Loma Linda University, where I delivered lectures and participated in research. I know that learning is a lifelong process. Currently, I serve as a Lecturer with the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Loma Linda University and as a Guest Lecturer at San Diego State University . I am also an invited speaker for the Emergency Medicine Department Residents at University of California, Davis . As a board-certified pediatric dentist I take additional courses that other pediatric dentists do not take, further enhancing my knowledge and expertise in the field of pediatric dentistry. By participating in continuing education courses, I am developing my knowledge base, which allows me to learn new ways to help treat my patients. Professional Memberships American Board of Pediatric Dentistry, Diplomate American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry American Dental Association California Dental Association San Diego County Dental Society Personal Life I fell in love with San Diego when I was in high school. So shortly after completing my residency program I decided to move to San Diego to start career. My wife, Lisa, and I met while students at Loma Linda University; she is a speech therapist. When I’m not caring for my patients or teaching, I enjoy exploring San Diego; whether that’s running at Mission Bay, exploring the tidepools near Cabrillo, or wandering the museums at Balboa Park. I also enjoy playing tennis, reading nonfiction, and overseas mission trips. I am passionate about providing dental care for children in underserved communities. I have had the opportunity to provide dental care for pediatric patients in Mexico, Bolivia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, and Papua New Guinea.

https://www.alohasmilesdental.com/meet-dr-won-chaekal,Dr. Won Chaekal,"Orthodontist Improving Lives with Beautiful Smiles My patients are like a second family to me. Each is unique and brings his or her own personality to the office. I enjoy getting to know patients personally while helping them achieve a beautifully healthy smile — one they’ll love for a lifetime! Our smiles are how we greet the world. When people have crooked teeth, they often feel self-conscious and uncomfortable at school and work. Patients start orthodontics with low self-esteem and a reluctance to engage with their peers. As they see their teeth start to move into proper position, these people begin to feel better about themselves. They make eye contact and walk taller. Best of all, they start to talk happily and laugh with others, and to share their smile. By the time they finish, each is a new person: smiling with confident ease! I am passionate about the lasting difference orthodontic care makes. Although many think of braces as being all about smiles, the reality is that properly positioned teeth improve oral health and make it easier to keep your teeth and gums healthy and clean. Orthodontics also means better function and less strain on the jaw, which lessens the likelihood of TMJ-TMD in the future. My profession enables me to improve lives by helping people I care about to achieve beautiful smiles. I can’t imagine anything more rewarding! Education and Continuing Education Bachelor of Science in biochemistry – University of California, Berkeley Doctorate of Dental Surgery – Columbia University Certificate in orthodontics – Columbia University Each year, I complete many hours of continuing education here in Hawaii and abroad. Orthodontics is constantly evolving, and I want to use the best technologies and techniques available. These make the orthodontic experience as effective and comfortable as possible for my patients. I’ve been an Elite Preferred Provider for Invisalign® treatment (reserved for the top 1% of providers nationwide) since 2008 and am a Pacific Northwest Regional Leader. I am one of only a handful of women in the world to have earned this title. I have successfully treated more than 1,000 patients with Invisalign and can accomplish outstanding results!

I grew as a person, my personality developed, and my self-esteem blossomed. I knew that my appearance changed, and that strengthened my confidence.

http://ascend-orthodontics.com/meet-the-team,Dr. Carly Schiro,"Background Hometown: Davisburg, MI Dental School: University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS Orthodontic Residency: University of Louisville School of Dentistry, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics Q&A: Why should we choose you as an Orthodontist? I see communication as one of my strengths as an Orthodontist. I see myself as a very compassionate person and doctor, but I’m also a big fan of open communication with patients and parents, even when they can be involved, hard conversations. I want to know your concerns first; I want you to know mine second; and I want to tackle them all in a way that is best for all of us so we can give you or your child the best smile with the healthiest bite possible. So you’re an Orthodontist, what else do you like to do besides move teeth? Dr. Anthony and I are big outdoor enthusiasts-- we love hiking, camping, golfing, and even simple walks with our pup, Riggins. I also love to cook and entertain friends and family. When I’m not in Colorado, I can be found back “Up North” in Michigan, floating in a boat at our family’s lake cottage. What are some areas of your life that you’d like to “Ascend” in? I have been so blessed to become a mom in recent years and that is one area of my life that I continually strive to “Ascend” in. Like so many of our patient families know, being a mom (or dad), while challenging, is oh so sweet. Dr. Anthony and I are so grateful to be in a profession that allows us to invest time with our kids (You’ll likely see them running around the office from time to time!) fun facts: I have a passion and dare I say talent for creating charcuterie boards! I’ve always been a health and fitness nut. You can find me wandering around a Farmer’s Market or getting in a session on our spin bike! I’ve developed a self-taught dabbling in graphic design. While I am certainly no professional, I love to create new, unique pieces--including our logo!",,"Davisburg, MI","Dental School: University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS Orthodontic Residency: University of Louisville School of Dentistry, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics",,
http://ascend-orthodontics.com/meet-the-team,Dr. Anthony Schiro,"Background Hometown: Okemos, MI University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics Q&A: Why Orthodontics? I’ve always had slight tendencies towards an “exacting” personality, so much so that as a young kid I would drive my parents crazy with how obsessive I was on where the seam of my socks fit. If it wasn’t just right, I needed new socks! Luckily, in dental school I found a new, better avenue for my obsession - perfecting people’s smiles :) I love that orthodontics allows me the opportunity to transform a smile, and it is in the final detailing that I really find my passion (and allow my meticulousness an outlet). I truly believe Dr. Carly and I are blessed to be able to practice Orthodontics. What is one mountain you’re proud to have submitted? While I’ve not tackled a 14er yet (on my bucket list), I have become a husband and a dad in recent years and those are two pretty great “peaks”! What’s your favorite ski area? I have to pick a home state resort as one of my favorites! While we don’t get down there as often as we’d like, I think Telluride has both the best views and the most exciting runs. Plus, the town has fun activities for anyone not skiing during the day and so many restaurant options for the family afterwards! FUN FACTS: When I was in college I played Club Baseball at the University of Michigan, and during our regional tournament we got to play in the stadium that “A League of Their Own” was filmed. When I was 12, I got lost on a ski mountain for what seemed like hours. I accidentally skied too far ahead of our group (because I loved going straight and fast) and ended up separated from everyone. This happened at Heavenly resort in California; now I make sure to always keep an eye on the group here in Colorado! One of my favorite movies is the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I especially love Groot! We even have a Baby Groot figurine sitting on a windowsill of our home.",,"Okemos, MI","University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics",,
