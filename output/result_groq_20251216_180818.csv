Each day I think of how I can improve the quality of my work, in order to provide patients with the advanced, quality dentistry they deserve. As a dentist, it is a pleasure to care for down-to-earth individuals and to share in their lives through the years. I appreciate that we can trade jokes, talk about mountain bike trails, or celebrate a new a member of their family, all while in a dental office. One of the most rewarding aspects of my career is having the ability to positively impact people’s lives. Whether relieving pain, offering practical education, addressing sleep disorders, or promoting overall health, with each interaction I can help people. I especially love restorative work and seeing people leave the office with new smiles, smiles they love and that will boost their confidence in life! ~ Dr. Koalby Brown Education and Continuing Education Dr. Brown grew up in Ogden, Utah. He attended Utah State University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Science. His Doctorate of Dental Medicine was awarded by Midwestern University in Phoenix, Arizona.

https://www.allsmilespediatricdentist.com/meet-dr-job,Dr. Allen Job,"Note from Dr. Allen Job: Providing dentistry for children requires a calling. As a profession, it requires having a strong clinical skill set, a keen understanding of medical conditions, knowledge and application of child psychology, and most importantly, compassion and patience. I have always enjoyed working with children and adolescents, and love being able to help them with their oral health needs. Each day, as I meet with new patients and their parents, I challenge myself to make a positive impact during their visit. Many parents come burdened with fear, from their own past experiences, wishing their child will not have to go through the same. I am reminded daily of the responsibility parents place in my hands, to treat their children with the utmost care and respect. I listen to my patients’ concerns and strive to provide a caring, safe environment in which to have their treatment. It is through each encounter, one patient at a time, that we are able to make a difference in the lives of those we are honored to serve.

Each is unique and brings his or her own personality to the office. I enjoy getting to know patients personally while helping them achieve a beautifully healthy smile — one they’ll love for a lifetime! Our smiles are how we greet the world. When people have crooked teeth, they often feel self-conscious and uncomfortable at school and work. Patients start orthodontics with low self-esteem and a reluctance to engage with their peers. As they see their teeth start to move into proper position, these people begin to feel better about themselves. They make eye contact and walk taller. Best of all, they start to talk happily and laugh with others, and to share their smile. By the time they finish, each is a new person: smiling with confident ease! I am passionate about the lasting difference orthodontic care makes. Although many think of braces as being all about smiles, the reality is that properly positioned teeth improve oral health and make it easier to keep your teeth and gums healthy and clean. Orthodontics also means better function and less strain on the jaw, which lessens the likelihood of TMJ-TMD in the future. My profession enables me to improve lives by helping people I care about to achieve beautiful smiles. I can’t imagine anything more rewarding! Education and Continuing Education Bachelor of Science in biochemistry – University of California, Berkeley Doctorate of Dental Surgery – Columbia University Certificate in orthodontics – Columbia University Each year, I complete many hours of continuing education here in Hawaii and abroad. Orthodontics is constantly evolving, and I want to use the best technologies and techniques available. These make the orthodontic experience as effective and comfortable as possible for my patients. I’ve been an Elite Preferred Provider for Invisalign® treatment (reserved for the top 1% of providers nationwide) since 2008 and am a Pacific Northwest Regional Leader. I am one of only a handful of women in the world to have earned this title. I have successfully treated more than 1,000 patients with Invisalign and can accomplish outstanding results! Professional Memberships Hawaii Society of Orthodontists Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists American Association of Orthodontists American Dental Association Hawaii Dental Association California Dental Association Beyond the Office After growing up in Korea, I call Honolulu my home. My husband is Dr. Michon Morita and I’m Mom to two beautiful children. Being with my family is important to me, and I enjoy playing the piano.

http://ascend-orthodontics.com/meet-the-team,Dr. Carly Schiro,"Background Hometown: Davisburg, MI Dental School: University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS Orthodontic Residency: University of Louisville School of Dentistry, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics Q&A: Why should we choose you as an Orthodontist? I see communication as one of my strengths as an Orthodontist. I see myself as a very compassionate person and doctor, but Iâm also a big fan of open communication with patients and parents, even when they can be involved, hard conversations. I want to know your concerns first; I want you to know mine second; and I want to tackle them all in a way that is best for all of us so we can give you or your child the best smile with the healthiest bite possible. So youâre an Orthodontist, what else do you like to do besides move teeth? Dr. Anthony and I are big outdoor enthusiasts-- we love hiking, camping, golfing, and even simple walks with our pup, Riggins. I also love to cook and entertain friends and family. When Iâm not in Colorado, I can be found back âUp Northâ in Michigan, floating in a boat at our familyâs lake cottage. What are some areas of your life that youâd like to âAscendâ in? I have been so blessed to become a mom in recent years and that is one area of my life that I continually strive to âAscendâ in. Like so many of our patient families know, being a mom (or dad), while challenging, is oh so sweet. Dr. Anthony and I are so grateful to be in a profession that allows us to invest time with our kids (Youâll likely see them running around the office from time to time!) fun facts: I have a passion and dare I say talent for creating charcuterie boards! Iâve always been a health and fitness nut. You can find me wandering around a Farmerâs Market or getting in a session on our spin bike! Iâve developed a self-taught dabbling in graphic design. While I am certainly no professional, I love to create new, unique pieces--including our logo!",,"Davisburg, MI","University of Michigan School of Dentistry, DDS; University of Louisville School of Dentistry, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics",,
http://ascend-orthodontics.com/meet-the-team,Dr. Anthony Schiro,"Background Hometown: Okemos, MI University of Michigan School of Dentistry , DDS University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics Q&A: Why Orthodontics? Iâve always had slight tendencies towards an âexactingâ personality, so much so that as a young kid I would drive my parents crazy with how obsessive I was on where the seam of my socks fit. Â If it wasnât just right, I needed new socks! Â Luckily, in dental school I found a new, better avenue for my obsession - perfecting peopleâs smiles :) I love that orthodontics allows me the opportunity to transform a smile, and it is in the final detailing that I really find my passion (and allow my meticulousness an outlet). Â I truly believe Dr. Carly and I are blessed to be able to practice Orthodontics. What is one mountain youâre proud to have submitted? While Iâve not tackled a 14er yet (on my bucket list), I have become a husband and a dad in recent years and those are two pretty great âpeaksâ! Whatâs your favorite ski area? I have to pick a home state resort as one of my favorites! While we donât get down there as often as weâd like, I think Telluride has both the best views and the most exciting runs. Plus, the town has fun activities for anyone not skiing during the day and so many restaurant options for the family afterwards! FUNÂ FACTS: When I was in college I played Club Baseball at the University of Michigan, and during our regional tournament we got to play in the stadium that âA League of Their Ownâ was filmed. When I was 12, I got lost on a ski mountain for what seemed like hours. I accidentally skied too far ahead of our group (because I loved going straight and fast) and ended up separated from everyone. This happened at Heavenly resort in California; now I make sure to always keep an eye on the group here in Colorado! One of my favorite movies is the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I especially love Groot! We even have a Baby Groot figurine sitting on a windowsill of our home.",,"Okemos, MI","University of Michigan School of Dentistry, DDS; University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, MS and Certificate in Orthodontics",,
